Shack Labs Internship project
This project has 2 problem statements:
No 1: The goal is to understand the relationship between house features and how these variables affect the house price. Using more than one model, predict the price of the house using the given dataset. Please compare the accuracy of the models along with the drawbacks of each technique's assumptions before recommending the final prediction model.

Solution:
The given dataset is reviewed and some features were selected for performing data analysis and predictions.
Visualistion techniques like plotting of graphs and data structures like dictionaries were employed to get a better understanding of data.
3 features namely 'House size (sqft)','Distance from nearest Metro station (km)','House Age' were selected to perform predictions.
Four machine learing models namely Random forest,Multiple regression, BayesianRidge and ElasticNet were used and Random forest came out as the best fit.
